            A ketogenic diet is a low carb diet that helps you lose weight and has numerous health benefits.

            <div><p>
                The main air of a ketogenic diet is to reduce the carbohydrate intake so that the body will be forced to convert the available body fat to glucose as its primary source of energy. So when you reduce those carbs, your body-brain will send a signal to your body that it needs another source of energy. Your body will respond by using its stored fats as sugar source by converting them to glucose.

                <h3>Risks:</h3>
                During the diet transition you may experience uncomfortable side effects from significantly cutting carbs, sometimes called the “Keto Flu”. Hunger, headaches, nausea, fatigue, irritability, constipation and brain “fog” may last days. Sleep and hydration will help, but it may not be a pleasant transition into the diet.

                    The paleo diet is a plant based diet and lean protein diet. These were the foods that were obtained by hunting and gathering during the Paleolithic era. It excludes processed foods such as sugar,dairy, and grains. Some choose this diet because they want to return back to the meal plans of our early ancestors, while some choose paleo because they want to eat fewer calories and lose weight. Humans are not used to the modern way food is produced, and there are processed foods that are hard for many to digest. By going back to the way food used to be eaten, some people find it exxtremely beneficial for their health.

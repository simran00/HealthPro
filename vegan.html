                  The Vegan diet is a plant based diet that excludes any animal products. Some choose this diet for ethical or environmental reasons, while some choose veganism to maintain a healthy lifestyle.

                   The American Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, Dietitians of Canada, Australian National Health and Medical Research Council, New Zealand Ministry of Health, Harvard Medical School, and the British Dietetic Association believe that vegan diets can be followed in every stage of life, including infancy and pregnancy. The German Society for Nurtition, however, advises that during pregnancy and breast feeding and children shouldn't try this diet.

                   It is important to plan this diet efficiently. If not planned well, the vegan diet can lead to nutritional deficiencies.

     The low fat and high fiber portions in this diet can make you feel fuller for longer. This can lower more body weight and body mass index (BMI) compared to other diets. Vegan diets as well as other plant based diets can reduce risks of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, premature death, Alzheimer's disease and dying from heart disease or cancer. This diet is usally high in dietary fiber, magnesium, folic acid, vitamin C, vitamin E, iron and phytochemicals, and is low in saturated fat and cholesterol.

  <div><h3> Risks:</h3><p>
     Vegan diets are low in dietary energy, vitamin B12, vitamin D, iodine, iron, calcium, zinc and omega-3 fatty acids. Since vegan diets are lower on protien, it can cause blood sugar swings and eating too much carbohydrates.

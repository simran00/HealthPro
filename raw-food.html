A raw food diet consist of mostly or completely eating raw and unprocessed foods. At least 75% of the food you eat has to be raw and unprocessed in order for this diet to be followed correctly.  
</p></div>

The raw food diet carries the idea that eating mostly raw foods is the ideal way for humans to eat. Supporters of this diet believe that cooking food is harmful to human health because it destroys natural enzymes and reduces nutrients in foods.

Food is considered raw if it has never been heated over 104-118 degrees farenheight (40-48 degrees celsius). It can't be refined, pasteurized, treated with pesticides or processed in any way. Juicing, blending, dehydrating, soaking and sprouting are permitted.

Risks:  The level of effort this diet requires is high because eating out is nearly impossible and most meals you eat ,will require you to prepare your own meals which might be really time consuming. Some foods such as buckwheat, kidney beans, parsnips, cassava, peas seeds and alfalfa sprouts are toxic when eaten raw. Some eggs contain salmonella bacteria, and this can cause serious illness or death if eggs are consumed without being cooked. Meat that is eaten raw contains bacteria and viruses that can be very harmful. Mycobacteria bovis sometimes exists in raw mik and can lead to non-pulmonary tuberculosis if consumed.
